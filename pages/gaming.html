                Hollow Knight is a challenging and beautiful game that I have spent many hours playing. The game has a unique art style and a peaceful soundtrack. There was free DLC released for the game adding additional content such as the Grim Troop and Lifeblood. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding, with many difficult bosses and levels to overcome. I love exploring the world of Hollow Knight and discovering its secrets. The game has a deep and engaging story that kept me hooked from start to finish. I highly recommend Hollow Knight to anyone who enjoys challenging and atmospheric games.
